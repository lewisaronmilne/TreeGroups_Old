# TreeGroups_Old
The original version of TreeGroups. It's still more functional than the new one.

It was abandoned to be redone from scratch a few years later as it was easier to start over, than it would be to move most of the api calls to background scripts where they should've been to begin with.

The new version is [here](https://github.com/lewisaronmilne/TreeGroups), I'm still working on it.
